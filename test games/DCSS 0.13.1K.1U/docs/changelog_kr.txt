던전 관련 변경사항
------------------
* 보물창고는 5층 던전으로 변경되었고, 전체적인 던전 구조가 변경되었습니다.
* 칼날의 방의 던전 구조가 조정되었고, 이제 "흥미로운 옵션(interesting brands)"이 포함된 무기가 하나가 아닌 두 개가 등장합니다.
* 어비스 구조가 또다시 변경되었습니다. 이제 어비스는 5층까지 존재하지만, 여전히 무한하며,
  층을 내려갈수록 난이도가 높아집니다. 각각의 레벨은 각기 다른 지역으로 구성되어 있고,
  대부분의 지역은 예전의 어비스보다는 정적일 것입니다(지형 등이 자주 변하지 않는다는 뜻인듯).
  어비스의 룬은 어비스 3층 혹은 그보다 깊은 곳에서만 나타나며, 깊이 내려갈수록 룬이 나타날 확률은 높아집니다.
* 어비스의 룬은 특수 지형에만 생성되며, 더 이상 보통의 바닥에 랜덤하게 생성되지 않습니다.
* 어비스의 룬을 얻을 경우, 어비스로부터 나가는 출구가 나타나는 확률이 대폭 상승합니다.
* 많은 지구라트 등장 몬스터 조합이 약간 변경되었고, 몇몇 몬스터 조합은 전체적으로 변경되었습니다.
* 던전 돌파(Dungeon Sprint)모드에서는 더 이상 어비스로 갈 수 없습니다.
* 3종의 새로운 던전 돌파 맵이 추가되었습니다. ("썬더돔" by evilmike, "소굴", "피의 결투장" by st)
* 코큐투스, 게헨나, 뱀 소굴, 메인 던전에 새로운 던전 생성 규칙(레이아웃)이 추가되었습니다.
* 짐승굴 8층의 고정 특수 지형들이 추가되었으며, 그 외로도 짐승굴의 랜덤한 특수지형들이 추가되었습니다.
* "특수한 방" (코볼트,오크로 가득한 방, 벌집, 공동묘지, 젤리가 가득한 방 등)들이 변경되었습니다.
  이제는 좀 더 적절한 구조를 가진, 좀 더 적절한 깊이의 던전 내에서 등장하며, 더 이상 문이 배치되지 않습니다.
* 새로운 특수 지형이 추가되었습니다. - 신비로운 동물원, 말 그대로 신비로운 형태의 짐승들이 있습니다.
* '비밀문'이 사라지고, 몇몇 비밀문은 룬이 새겨진 문(봉인된 문)으로 교체되었습니다.
* 조트의 렐름의 새로운 던전 생성 규칙들이 추가되었습니다.
* 새로운 지형지물로 "룬이 새겨진 문"이 추가되었습니다. 이 문은 자동 탐색으로 열 수 없으며 몬스터가 열 수 없습니다.
  이 문을 열면 보통의 일반적인 문이 됩니다.
* 알람 트랩은 더 이상 반복해서 작동하지 않고 한 번만 작동합니다.
* 여러가지 장식적인 특수지형들이 추가되었습니다.


캐릭터 관련 변경사항
--------------------
* 추적자 직업이 삭제되었습니다.
* 검투사는 더 이상 작은 원형 방패(buckler)을 들고 시작하지 않습지만, 그 대신 좀 더 높은 회피술을 가지고 시작합니다.
* 비밀문 개념이 사라져, '함정과 문 기술'은 '함정 기술'로 변경되었습니다.
* 함정을 찾거나 찾지 못하는 것은 이제 함정 기술 스킬을 통


* Traps are spotted (or not) deterministically based on skill level and a
  few other factors: spending more time does not help.

* Levitation and controlled flight are no more - all flight is controlled.
* Flying no longer increases carrying capacity.
* Carrying capacity is slightly less dependent on strength.
* Tengu receive their movement speed bonus when flying, regardless of burden.
* Black draconians gain permanent flight (like Tengu but without the speed
  boost) at XL 14.
* Experience aptitude uses the same scale as skill aptitudes. This scale is
  coarser than the old one, so most races now require slightly more or less
  experience to gain levels than before.
* Deep Elves are better at Earth magic than Air.
* Hill Orcs are better at Axes, worse at gaining levels.
* Tengu are better at gaining levels.
* Berserkers may choose their starting weapon.

  distance.

    - Deep troll shamans: cast Might Other and Haste Other on their
      accompanying deep troll packs.
    - Deep troll earth mages: cast Dig and LRD to allow the rest of the deep
      troll pack to pursue their opponent.
* New vaults monsters:
    - Vault sentinels, with a signal horn that generates a lot of noise and
      the Sentinel's Mark spell which alerts all creatures on the level to
      the player's location.
    - Vault wardens, with the ability to close and seal doors near the player
      for a time or until they are killed.
    - Ironbrand convokers, with the ability to recall other monsters on the

  aut.

Items
-----
* Axes have a cleaving attack: they hit up to seven targets with a single
  swing (all directions except directly opposite the direction of attack,
  but not if a wall is in the way). These secondary attacks do only 75%
  damage and do not hit allies. Base damage for the larger axes is reduced
  to compensate.

  a one point damage increase, and morningstars get a +3/-1 damage/accuracy
  boost to replace spiked flails.

  type, not necessarily the ability to wield it.

  severely reduces the wielder's HP.

* Staff of Wucad Mu is now +9,+9 rather than caring about intelligence.

  defender.

  but only when the item is unequipped.

  Trog).

  one-handed for normal-size races.

  levels.
